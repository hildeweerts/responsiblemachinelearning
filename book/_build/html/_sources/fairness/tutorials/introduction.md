:link: tutorial_measuringfairness
:link-type: ref

Explore how to measure notions of group fairness via a disaggregated analysis in Python using Fairlearn. As a running example, we consider pre-trial risk assessment scores produced by the COMPAS recidivism risk assessment tool.

*After this tutorial you are able to:*

- *perform a disaggregated analysis in Python using Fairlearn;*
- *describe the relevance of reliability of estimates and validity of measurements in relation to quantitative fairness assessments;*
- *explain the incompatibility between three group fairness criteria;*
