<p>In recent years, there has been an increasing awareness amongst both the public and scientific community that algorithmic systems can reproduce, amplify, or even introduce unfairness in our societies. From automated resume screening tools that favor men over women to facial recognition systems that fail disproportionately for darker-skinned women. In this chapter, we provide an introduction to algorithmic fairness, list several types of fairness-related harm, and explain why there is no fairness through unawareness.</p>
<div class="section" id="unfair-machines">
<h2>Unfair Machines<a class="headerlink" href="#unfair-machines" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Machine learning applications often make predictions about people. For example, algorithmic systems may be used to decide whether a resume makes it through the first selection round, judge the severity of a medical condition, or determine whether somebody will receive a loan. Since these systems are usually trained on massive amounts of data, they have the potential to be more consistent than human decision-makers with varying levels of experience. For example, consider a resume screening process. In a non-automated scenario, the likelihood to get through the resume selection round can depend on the personal beliefs of the recruiter who happens to judge your resume. On the other hand, the predictions of an algorithmic resume screening system can be learned from the collective judgement of many different recruiters.</p>
<p>However, the workings of a machine learning model heavily depend on how the machine learning task is formulated and which data is used to train the model. Consequently, prejudices against particular groups can seep into the model in each step of the development process. For example, if in the past a company has hired more men than women, this will be reflected in the training data. The machine learning model is likely to pick up this pattern.</p>
<div class="admonition-example-amazon-s-resume-screening-model admonition">
<p class="admonition-title"><em>Example:</em> Amazon’s Resume Screening Model</p>
<p>In 2015, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G">Amazon tried to train a resume screening model</a>. In order to avoid biased predictions, the model did not explicitly take the applicant’s gender into account. However, it turned out that the model penalized resumes that included terms that suggested that the applicant was a woman. For example, resumes that included the word “women’s” (e.g., in “women’s chess club captain”) were less likely to be selected. Although Amazon stated the tool “was never used by Amazon recruiters to evaluate candidates”, this incident serves as an example of how machine learning models can, unintentially, replicate undesirable relationships between a sensitive characteristic and a target variable.</p>
</div>
<p>Notably, the characteristics that could potentially make algorithmic systems desirable over human-decision making, also amplify fairness related risks. One prejudiced recruiter can judge a few dozen resumes each day, but an algorithmic system can process thousands of resumes in the blink of an eye. If an algorithmic system is biased in any way, harmful consequences will be structural and can occur at an exceptionally large scale. Even in applications where predictions do not directly consider individuals, people can be unfairly impacted . For example, a machine learning model that predicts the future value of houses can influence the actual sale prices. If some neighborhoods receive much lower house price predictions than others, this may disproportionately affect some groups over others.</p>
<p>Discrimination and bias of algorithmic systems is not a new problem. Well over two decades ago, Friedman and Nissenbaum<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-friedman1996" id="id1">1</a> analyzed fairness of computer systems. However, with the increasing use of algorithmic systems, it has become clear that the issue is far from solved. Researchers from a range of disciplines have started working on unraveling the mechanisms in which algorithmic systems can undermine fairness and how these risks can be mitigated.</p>
<p>This has given rise to the research field of <a class="reference internal" href="../misc/glossary.html#term-algorithmic-fairness"><span class="xref std std-term">algorithmic fairness</span></a>: the idea that algorithmic systems should behave or treat people fairly, i.e., without discrimination on the grounds of <a class="reference internal" href="../misc/glossary.html#term-sensitive-characteristic"><span class="xref std std-term">sensitive characteristic</span></a>s such as age, sex, disability, ethnic or racial origin, religion or belief, or sexual orientation. Here, sensitive characteristic refers to a characteristic of an individual such that any decisions based on this characteristic are considered undesirable from an ethical or legal point of view.</p>
<p>Note that this definition of algorithmic fairness is very broad. This is intentional. The concept is applicable to all types of algorithmic systems, including different flavors of artificial intelligence (e.g., symbolic approaches, expert systems, and machine learning), but also simple rule-based systems.</p>

<div class="section" id="types-of-harm">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>Types of Harm<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-harm" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The exact meaning of “behaving or treating people fairly” depends heavily on the context of the algorithmic system. There are several different ways in which algorithmic systems can disregard fairness. In particular, we can distinguish between the following types of fairness-related harms<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-madaio2020" id="id3">2</a>.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="none"><img alt="A process model of a machine learning development process, with a chain of blocks starting at &quot;problem formulation&quot;, followed by &quot;collect data&quot;, &quot;train model&quot;, &quot;make predictions&quot;, &quot;make decisions&quot;, and finally &quot;impact&quot;." class="align-center" src="../_images/fairnessharms.svg" width="600px" /></a>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="xref std std-term">Allocation harm</span> can be defined as an unfair allocation of opportunities, resources, or information. In our resume selection example, allocation harm can occur when some groups are selected less often than others, e.g., the algorithm selects men more often than women.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="xref std std-term">Quality-of-service harm</span> occurs when a system disproportionately fails for certain (groups of) people. For example, a facial recognition system may misclassify black women at a higher rate than white men <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-buolamwini2018" id="id4">3</a> and a speech recognition system may not work well for users whose disability impacts their clarity of speech <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-guo2019" id="id5">4</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="xref std std-term">Stereotyping harm</span> occurs when a system reinforces undesirable and unfair societal stereotypes. Stereotyping harm are particularly prevalent in systems that rely on unstructed data, such as natural language processing and computer vision systems. The reason for this is that societal stereotypes are often deeply embedded in text corpora and image labels. For example, an image search for “CEO” may primarily show photos of white men.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="xref std std-term">Denigration harm</span> refers to situations in which algorithmic systems are actively derogatory or offensive. For example, an automated tagging system may <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/1/8880363/google-apologizes-photos-app-tags-two-black-people-gorillas">misclassify people as animals</a> and a chat bot might <a class="reference external" href="https://fortune.com/2020/09/29/artificial-intelligence-openai-gpt3-toxic/">start using derogatory slurs</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="xref std std-term">Representation harm</span> occurs when the development and usage of algorithmic systems over- or under-represents certain groups of people For example, some racial groups may be overly scrutinized during welfare fraud investigations or neighborhoods with a high elderly population may be ignored because data on disturbances in the public space (such as <a class="reference external" href="https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-hidden-biases-in-big-data">potholes</a> is collected using a smartphone app. Representation harm can be connected to allocation harms and quality-of-service harms. However, a lack of diversity by itself can already be considered a violation of fairness. Moreover, representation harm can already occur even before the algorithmic system makes a single prediction, which makes it important to consider from the start.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="xref std std-term">Procedural harm</span> occurs when decisions are made in a way that violates social norms (see e.g., Rudin <em>et al.</em><a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-rudin2018a" id="id6">5</a>). For example, penalizing a job applicant for having more experience can violate social norms. Procedural harm is not limited to the prediction-generating mechanisms of the model itself, but can also be extended to the development and usage of the system. For example, is it communicated clearly that an algorithmic decision is made? Do data subjects receive a meaningful justification? Is it possible to appeal a decision?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that these types of harm are not mutually exclusive and that this list is not complete – there may be other context and application specific harms.</p>

<h2>Biases<a class="headerlink" href="#biases" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Anybody who has ever attempted to build a machine learning model will know that machine learning systems are an accumulation of design choices that shape what the final model will look like. From high-level decisions related to the goal of the model, to a plethora of detailed choices such as whether you will use one-hot-encoding for that categorical feature in your data set. These puzzles are part of what makes machine learning development interesting and creative work. However, choosing the ‘best’ option implicitly involves a value judgment. This has important moral implications. In the context of algorithmic fairness, a major concern revolves different forms of biases that can seep into a machine learning system through various design choices. In this section, we will explore several of these biases as sources of fairness-related harm.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-bias">
<h3>What is Bias?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>But first, let us define more precisely what we mean when we talk about ‘bias’. In the dictionary, <span class="xref std std-term">bias</span> is defined as “a systematic and disproportionate tendency towards something”. It can refer to many different things, ranging from social biases related to prejudice, to statistical biases that are of a technical nature.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="none"><img alt="A process model of a machine learning development process, with a chain of blocks starting at &quot;problem formulation&quot;, followed by &quot;collect data&quot;, &quot;train model&quot;, &quot;make predictions&quot;, &quot;make decisions&quot;, and finally &quot;impact&quot;." class="align-center" src="../_images/bias.svg" width="300px" /></a>
<div class="section" id="social-and-systemic-bias">
<h4>Social and Systemic bias<a class="headerlink" href="#social-and-systemic-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In everyday language, bias is typically used to refer to prejudice against a person or a group. To avoid confusion, we will generally refer this type of bias as <span class="xref std std-term">social bias</span>. Social bias is a form of <span class="xref std std-term">cognitive bias</span>: a systematic error in rational thinking that can affect judgment and decision-making. Several theoretical explanations of <span class="xref std std-term">cognitive bias</span>es exist. In particular, the biases are thought to be the result of the limitations of information-processing capabilities of the human brain. From an evolutionary perspective, cognitive biases might have been useful because they allow people to make quick decisions in critical scenarios. As a hunter-gatherer, you would probably rather be safe than sorry when encountering an unknown group of other humans. However, shortcuts and heuristics often come at the cost of the quality of decisions. In particular, stereotypes formed by <span class="xref std std-term">social bias</span> can be overgeneralized and inaccurate, especially on an individual level. When people act on <span class="xref std std-term">social bias</span>es, they can result in discriminatory practices. Social bias is not limited to human actors and can also be embedded in instititutions, in which case it is typically referred to as <span class="xref std std-term">systemic bias</span> or <span class="xref std std-term">institutional bias</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statistical-bias">
<h4>Statistical Bias<a class="headerlink" href="#statistical-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>If you have ever done an introductory course on statistics or machine learning theory, you have almost certainly come across <span class="xref std std-term">statistical bias</span>. In this context, ‘bias’ refers to a systematic error in the estimation of parameters or variables. For example, you may have come across a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Sample_variance">naive estimation of sample variance</a> in one of your statistics classes, which is a provably biased estimate of true variance of a population. In other cases, <span class="xref std std-term">statistical bias</span> is used to refer to biases in the data collection process that compromise the accuracy of an estimate. For example, respondents of a twitter poll are rarely a random sample of the population. Bias is also used to refer to systematic errors caused by assumptions of an estimator. In the context of machine learning algorithms, this type of bias is often discussed in relation to the bias-variance trade-off. For example, some machine learning algorithms can only learn linear relationships between features, whereas the true underlying data distribution exhibits more complex relationships, resulting in an <a class="reference internal" href="../misc/glossary.html#term-underfitting"><span class="xref std std-term">underfitting</span></a> model.</p>

<h3>Biases in a Machine Learning Development Process<a class="headerlink" href="#biases-in-a-machine-learning-development-process" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>There are many different types of bias that can result in fairness-related harm. Most of these issues arise at the intersections of social, systemic, and statistical bias. In the remainder of this section, we will dive more deeply into different types of biases during data collection and modelling.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="none"><img alt="A process model of a machine learning development process, with a chain of blocks starting at &quot;problem formulation&quot;, followed by &quot;collect data&quot;, &quot;train model&quot;, &quot;make predictions&quot;, &quot;make decisions&quot;, and finally &quot;impact&quot;." class="align-center" src="../_images/process.svg" width="500px" /></a>

<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>The list of biases discussed in this chapter is by no means exhaustive. Moreover, reality is messy, and in practice biases are much harder to precisely dissect than many research papers suggest.

<div class="section" id="historical-bias-social-biases-encoded-in-data">
<h4>Historical Bias: Social Biases Encoded in Data<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-bias-social-biases-encoded-in-data" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>When it comes to bias, one stage of the development process is arguably the most notirous: data collection and processing. While <em>bias in = bias out</em> only scratches the surface of fairness issues (more on that later), data sets are important sources of fairness-related harm.</p>
<p>One of the seemingly most obvious ways in which data can be biased is when social biases are explicitly encoded in data, typically in the form of an association between a <span class="xref std std-term">sensitive feature</span> and the <a class="reference internal" href="../misc/glossary.html#term-target-variable"><span class="xref std std-term">target variable</span></a>. If not accounted for, a machine learning model will reproduce these biases, resulting in unfair outcomes. Generally speaking, <span class="xref std std-term">historical bias</span> comes in two flavors.</p>
<p>First, <span class="xref std std-term">historical bias</span> can arise due to social biases in historical decision-making, resulting in <span class="xref std std-term">measurement bias</span>. Generally speaking, <span class="xref std std-term">measurement bias</span> occurs when the method of observation results in systematic errors. When <span class="xref std std-term">measurement bias</span> is related to a <span class="xref std std-term">sensitive feature</span>, such as gender or race, it can be a source of downstream model unfairness. For example, a company may have historically hired more men than women for technical positions due to social bias. In this case, historical hiring decisions are a biased proxy for actual suitability of the applicant. A model trained on historical decisions will likely reproduce the association. Another example can be found in fraud detection. A fraud analyst might overly scrutinize some groups over others. Higher rates of testing will result in more positives, confirming the analysts biased beliefs and skewing the observed base rates. If not accounted for, these skewed numbers will be reproduced by the machine learning model. Inaccurate stereotypes can also be embedded in texts, images, and annotations produced by people, resulting in systems that reinforce these stereotypes. It is important to emphasize that simply removing the <span class="xref std std-term">sensitive feature</span> is unlikely to mitigate this type of bias, due to associations between features (see also <span class="xref myst">No Fairness through Unawareness</span>).</p>
<p>A second type of <span class="xref std std-term">historical bias</span>  occurs when the data is a good representation of reality, but reality is biased. In the hiring example, observed bias could also be caused by actual differences in suitability, but these differences are in turn caused by structural inequalities in society. For example, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may have had fewer opportunities to get good education, making them less suitable for jobs where such education is required for job performance. Similarly, some stereotypes are accurate at an aggregate level (even if they can be very inaccurate at an individual level!). For example, in many societies female nurses still greatly outnumber male nurses.</p>
<p>In practice, it is impossible to distinguish between these two types of <span class="xref std std-term">historical bias</span> from observed data alone. For example, we cannot know the true underlying fraud rate if we only take into account data produced by a biased fraud detection approach. Moreover, when social biases are involved, cases of measurement bias and structural inequality often occur simultaneously. However, while <span class="xref std std-term">measurement bias</span> can be mitigated by thoughtful and high-quality data collection, meaningfully addressing structural injustice in the context of a single machine learning model is not as much a technical question as a moral one (we will dive deeper into this type of questions in <a class="reference internal" href="interdisciplinary/ethics.html#normative-underpinnings"><span class="std std-ref">Choosing the “Right” Fairness Metric</span></a>).</p>

<div class="section" id="disparate-informativeness-representation-bias-and-predictive-bias">
<h4>Disparate Informativeness: Representation Bias and Predictive Bias<a class="headerlink" href="#disparate-informativeness-representation-bias-and-predictive-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<!-- TODO: add parts about noise/variance by Chen et al.-->
<p>A different set of data biases are related to the informativeness of the data for different sensitive groups.</p>
<p>A data set can be less informative for a sensitive group if less data points are available. In particular, <span class="xref std std-term">representation bias</span> occurs when some groups are underrepresented in the data <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-suresh2020" id="id7">6</a>. A machine learning model might not generalize well for underrepresented groups, causing <span class="xref std std-term">allocation harm</span> or <span class="xref std std-term">quality-of-service harm</span>. <span class="xref std std-term">Representation bias</span> is especially risky when the data distribution of minority groups differs substantially from the majority group (see also <span class="xref std std-term">aggregation bias</span>). A well-known example of <span class="xref std std-term">representation bias</span> was uncovered by Buolamwini and Gebru<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-buolamwini2018" id="id8">3</a>. They found that the data sets that were used to train commercial facial recognition systems contained predominantly images of white men. Consequently, the models did not generalize well to people with dark skin, especially women.
<span class="xref std std-term">Representation bias</span> is closely related to <span class="xref std std-term">selection bias</span>, a statistical bias that occurs when the data collection or selection results in a non-random sample of the population. If not taken into account, conclusions regarding the studied effect may be wrong. For example, young healthy people may be more likely to volunteer for a vaccine trial than less healthy older people. As a result, conclusions about the side effects may not be representative for the whole population. Notably, <span class="xref std std-term">representation bias</span> can occur even when a sample is truly random, as there may not be sufficient information available for minority groups. Moreover, <span class="xref std std-term">representation bias</span> can be an issue in both training and testing data.
An underlying cause of <span class="xref std std-term">representation bias</span> are blind spots of the collectors. For example, a data science team that consists solely of women is less likely to notice that men are not well represented in the data than a more diverse team. Additionally, some data is easier to get than others. For example, collecting data on the interests of young adults, who often spend hours each day scrolling through their social media feeds, is much easier compared to the interests elderly people who are generally not as active online.</p>
<p>The informativeness of the data can also be affected by <span class="xref std std-term">predictive bias</span>, which occurs when the informativeness of the features differs across groups. In this case, it is not so much the amount of data that is relevant, but the quality of that data for a predictive task. For example, women face different risk factors for heart disease compared to men, including pregnancy and menopause induced factors. If we were to build a machine learning model that does not take into account these features, the model is likely to be less accurate for women than it is for men.</p>
<p><span class="xref std std-term">Representation bias</span> is relatively easy to solve by getting more data. Additionally, data scientists can leverage techniques that were designed to deal with sampling errors, such as weighting instances. However, one should be cautious to not overburden already marginalized groups. Moreover, it is hard to justify harming other values, such as privacy and autonomy, on your quest for more data. For example, after IBM released their “diverse data set”, it became clear that the data set <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facial-recognition-s-dirty-little-secret-millions-online-photos-scraped-n981921">contained millions of photos that were retrieved from the internet</a> without consent. Similarly, researchers attempting to increase predictive performance of facial recognition systems for transgender persons, proceeded to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16180080/transgender-youtubers-ai-facial-recognition-dataset">collect a set of Youtube video links of transgender individuals</a>, without informing them. Predictive bias, on the other hand, cannot be solved by collecting more data, only by collecting better data. For example, we may carefully consider which additional features should be added to the model, e.g. by consulting domain experts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aggregation-bias">
<h4>Aggregation bias<a class="headerlink" href="#aggregation-bias" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Building a machine learning model includes many different choices, ranging from the class of machine learning algorithms that is considered to their hyperparameter settings. Different models may have different consequences related to fairness, depending on the task at hand.</p>
<p><span class="xref std std-term">Aggregation bias</span> occurs when a single model is used for groups that have distinct data distributions <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-suresh2020" id="id9">6</a>. If not accounted for, it may lead to a model that does not work well for any of the subgroups. For example, it is known that the relationship between hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) and blood glucose levels differs greatly across genders and ethnicities <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-suresh2020" id="id10">6</a>. If these differences are not taken into account, a model that only uses a single interpretation of HbA1c will likely not work well for any of these groups. In combination with <span class="xref std std-term">representationbias</span>, it can lead to a model that only works well for the majority population.</p>
<p><span class="xref std std-term">Aggregation bias</span> is related to the problem of <a class="reference internal" href="../misc/glossary.html#term-underfitting"><span class="xref std std-term">underfitting</span></a>. Machine learning can be seen as a compression problem that produces a mapping between input features and output variable. Some information is inherently lost because of the chosen mapping <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#footcite-dobbe2018" id="id11">7</a>. In particular, some model classes may not be able to adequately capture the different data distributions. Such an oversimplified model may come at the cost of predictive performance for minority groups, resulting in <span class="xref std std-term">quality-of-service harm</span>.</p>
