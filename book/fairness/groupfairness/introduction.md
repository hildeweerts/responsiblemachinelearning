A straightforward way to approach fairness is to consider whether some groups are treated worse, on average, than other groups. {term}`group fairness` is a notion of fairness that requires group statistics to be equal across (sub)groups defined by sensitive characteristic. It is sometimes referred to as statistical fairness. Group fairness is an intuitive notion of fairness that is relatively easy to put into operation. For example, allocation harm can be quantified as a group fairness metric by comparing a classifier's selection rates across different groups. We can quantify quality-of-service harm and representation harm in a similar way.
